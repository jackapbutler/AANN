# AANN
Artificial Arduino Neural Network using Arduino Nano.

A collection of various scripts related to Arduino Nano and Uno boards. Each folder describes scripts and wiring layouts for the associated Arduino board.

# Setup 

1. You will need to install the Arduino IDE or Web Editor to interface with the boards.

2. Assemble the circuit following the diagrams named `layout.png` in the folders.

3. Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board using the IDE or Web Interface.
  > This will execute the code on the microcontroller.
